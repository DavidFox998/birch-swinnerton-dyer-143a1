/-! ## 4. Validity: each of the 10 forms is reduced and has disc = -143 -/

/-- Every triple in `forms143` is a genuine reduced BQF with discriminant -143.

    Proof: for each of the 10 concrete triples, unfold disc/IsReduced and close
    with omega (handles all concrete integer arithmetic including the symmetry
    implication `a = c → 0 ≤ b`). -/

/-! ## 5. Completeness: no other reduced form exists -/

/-- **Key bound helper.**  For any `b, a : Int` with `−a < b ≤ a`, we have `b·b ≤ a·a`.

    Proof: sign case split on `b`.
    - `b ≥ 0`: `Int.mul_self_le_mul_self` with `0 ≤ b ≤ a`.
    - `b < 0`: `0 ≤ -b ≤ a` (from strict `-a < b`), same lemma on `-b`,
      then `Int.neg_mul_neg b b` converts `(-b)·(-b)` back to `b·b`. -/

/-- Every reduced BQF with discriminant -143 appears in `forms143`.

    Proof sketch:
    • `a ≥ 1`          from `−a < b ≤ a`.
    • `b·b ≤ a·a`      from `sq_bound`.
    • `a·a ≤ a·c`      from `a ≤ c` multiplied left by `a ≥ 0`.
    • `3·(a·a) ≤ 143`  combining:
        `4·(a·c) = b·b + 143`  (disc condition)
        `4·(a·a) ≤ 4·(a·c)`   (from `a·a ≤ a·c`)
        `b·b ≤ a·a`
        `⟹  4·(a·a) ≤ a·a + 143  ⟹  3·(a·a) ≤ 143`.
    • `a ≤ 6`           because `a ≥ 7 ⟹ 7·a ≤ a·a ⟹ 49 ≤ a·a ⟹ 147 ≤ 143` ⊥.
    • Case-split on `a ∈ {1,…,6}`, then on `b` in the range `−a < b ≤ a`.
      Each leaf either has no integer solution for `c` (omega) or gives a unique
      concrete triple that `decide` confirms is in `forms143`. -/

/-! ## 6. Main certificate -/

/-- **Certificate**: there are exactly 10 reduced positive-definite binary quadratic
    forms of discriminant -143.

    Proof:
    • `forms143_length` + `forms143_nodup`  → list has 10 distinct entries.
    • `forms143_valid`                       → each entry is genuinely reduced + disc = -143.
    • `forms143_complete`                    → no other reduced form exists.

    This certifies h(ℚ(√-143)) = 10 at the level of reduced BQFs.
    The formal bridge to `NumberField.classNumber` requires
    `BinaryQuadraticForm.classGroupEquiv`, absent from Mathlib v4.12.0
    — see `BSD_BQF_ClassNumber_bridge_OPEN` in `BSD_ReducedForms.lean`. -/
